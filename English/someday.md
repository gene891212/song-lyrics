```
Was good to know you
But I'm not gonna
Pretend I'm all better
Thought we were forever
Hearts still in pieces
And your shadow follows me places, all the time
I can't shake this feeling of loneliness
That's just life I guess

But I believe, someday soon I'll learn to overcoming
The scale will heal, heart will bloom
No more dwelling
'Cause today I choose to say
I will love again someday
So I'm not gonna stay
Paralyzed 'cause I'm not by your side

Time passes slowly
Makes me feel lonely
Gotta stop feeling sorry
I can't always feel worried
Mind won't stop spinning
And I keep on overthinking, all the time
I hope with time the healing will mend my soul
And I can let you go

But I believe, someday soon I'll learn to overcoming
The scale will heal, heart will bloom
No more dwelling
'Cause today I choose to say
I will love again someday
So I'm not gonna stay
Paralyzed 'cause I'm not by your side

But I believe, that I will be, much better eventually
But I won't forget our love, ever
Time heals all, know that time heals all

I believe that someday soon, I'll remember you with a smile
And overcome
And I will overcome
Someday soon I'll overcome, someday soon I'll Over, over-come
I choose to say
I will love again someday, again someday
I'll overcome
```
